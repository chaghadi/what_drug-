# Drug Response Prediction with PySpark

This project builds a multiclass classification model to predict which drug a patient will respond to based on clinical data. The classifier was trained using PySpark's MLlib and evaluated on precision, recall, and F1 score.

## ðŸ”¬ Problem Statement

Given a dataset of patients with the following features:

- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure (BP)
- Cholesterol

...the task is to predict the correct **drug** the patient should be prescribed from:

- Drug A
- Drug B
- Drug C
- Drug X
- Drug Y

This is a **multiclass classification problem**.
